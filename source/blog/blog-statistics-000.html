        <h3>Basic statistics</h3>
        <hr>
        <p> I am not a fan of statistics, but this does not influence the role of statistics as a golden standard in
            most scientific research. I like the basic idea of statistics, like the commonly seen statistical
            "jargon" (standard deviation, standard error, p value, r square, and t test). The reasons are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>these statistical definition is easy to understand and easy to interpret;</li>
            <li>these parameters can be used to make comparisons;                        </li>
            <li>you can write or customize these basic statistical tools easily.         </li>
        </ul>
        <p> I am very against complicated statistics because "most statistics is lying". When people use complicated
            statistical tools instead of the basic statistical ideas, like p value, basically their results are not
            significantly different from zero hypothesis. Believe me, if the results are significant, no one bothers
            to use other tools while the basic statistics is most convincing.</p>
        <p> There are many research using statistical tools, and most of them use only basic statistics. However, it
            does not mean that using basic statistics is always the right option. I am a researcher doing both theory
            and experiments on plant hydraulics, so one of my interests is building a model to simulate the gas
            exchange process as well as water transport of terrestrial trees. The commonly used gas exchange models
            are empirical models and optimization models. As there are more than one model, people are devoted to make
            comparisons among models in order to convince people that their model performs better. Then the question is
            how should we make the comparisons, can we do it with basic statistics?</p>
        
        <h3>Widely used R-square comparison</h3>
        <hr>
        
        <h3>Yujie's comments</h3>
        <hr>
        <p> The quality of a model depends on the prediction power, i.e. the ability to make predictions close to
            experimental observations. Thus, the quality depends on the following aspects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the distance from the predicted means to experimental means;</li>
            <li>the mean variation from the predictions to observations.    </li>
        </ul>
