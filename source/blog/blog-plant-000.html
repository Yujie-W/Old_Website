        <h1 align="center">Are tropical rainforests a carbon source or a carbon sink?</h1>
        <p  align="center">Yujie Wang, 2017-11-29</p>
        
        <h3>Funny algorithm</h3>
        <hr>
        <p> There was a recent research published on "Science" about the carbon cycle in tropical ranforest (
            <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aam5962" target="_blank">DOI</a>). The authors argued that the
            tropical rainforests were a carbon source from aboveground observations from 2003 to 2014. I have to say
            "Where is the logic?"</p>
        <p> In their calculations, the gain of carbon is the forest growth, and the cost is the deforestation or plant
            density loss caused by disturblance. In brief, the algorithm is to compare the total carbon amount of
            current state versus the total carbon amount of the last state. What a simple and "logical" calculation!</p>
        <p> According to their algorithm, Arabic countries are the number one carbon source. First, you calculate the
            total solid or liquid carbon of last year. Second, you calculate the total solid or liquid carbon of this
            year. Or you don't have to calculate all at, just check the oil market information! Is this fair?</p>
        <p> Or we may think in another scenario, we have a big forest that is used for wood production. We cut down
            trees every year to make furniture or to make fire at a reasonable speed. The total carbon of the forest is
            constant every year. So? Forest is not carbon sink or source. We, the human beings, are using the furniture
            that we did not own last year. We "creat" carbon, we are the carbon sink! What an amazing world!</p>
        
        <h3>What is carbon source and what is carbon sink</h3>
        <hr>
        <p> The definitions of carbon source and sink in ecology refer to the source and sink of gaseous
            CO<sub>2</sub>. For example, human beings breathe out CO<sub>2</sub> means human beings are carbon source;
            a tree photosynthesizes and uptakes CO<sub>2</sub> means the tree is a carbon sink. As to whether an
            eco-system is a carbon source or a carbon sink depends on the balance of gaseous phase CO<sub>2</sub>. In
            this case, if a man compressed the CO<sub>2</sub> he breathes to a tank and never releases it back, then he
            is not a source; if a man compressed more CO<sub>2</sub> than he breathes into a tank, then he can be a
            sink. As to the eco-system, where there is no solid or liquid phase CO<sub>2</sub> exchange, the total gain
            would be the photosynthesis, and the total gain will be the total respiration. Therefore, the computation
            used in the science paper was wrong!</p>
        <p> The carbon source definition used by those authors is in the solid phase carbon but not gaseous phase. Then
            it becomes clear that the tropical rainforests are a source of wood, and it is also clear that the human
            world is the sink of wood. Any of the above arguments are right, but people should recognize the definitons
            of carbon source and carbon sink.</p>
        
        <h3>Yujie's Comments</h3>
        <hr>
        <p> I understand people's concern over the deforestation of amazon rainforest, and it can really be a disaster
            for human beings if we continue to destry our liveing environment. However, science is science; it is not
            a tool to blame the developing countries. Please be logical and professional in the research!</p>
