                        <p> I did not have passion in plant science until my last year in University of Science and
                            Technology of China at 2010, in which summer I visited Cao's lab in Xishuangbanna Tropical
                            Botanical Garden. I worked on early angiosperms for a few months as my undergraduate
                            thesis. Then I continued my master study at the same university and did some experiments on
                            hydraulic conductance methodology during 2011&ndash;2013 in Xishuangbanna. After that, I
                            visited Tyree lab at Northwest Agriculture & Forestry University as "post-master" for 2
                            years and headed to Sperry Lab in 2015. Before heading into the science filed, my dream was
                            becoming a poet, and it seems that I may not realize my dream throughout my life.

                        <p> Dr. Cao is a professor in College of Forestry, Guangxi University, CN. His research focuses
                            on the plant water relations as well as the photosynthesis, such as the grass root
                            pressure, tree sap flux, leaf photo damage, and plant evolution. He used to work in
                            Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, where I finished my bachelor thesis from 2010
                            &ndash;2011 and my master thesis from 2011&ndash;2013 with his guidance. He enlightened
                            many Chinese researchers in the field of plant hydraulics, such as Guangyou Hao and
                            Yongjiang Zhang.

                        <p> Dr. Sperry is a professor in Department of Biology, University of Utah, USA. He works on
                            plant water relations, such as xylem cavitation, water transport, stomatal behavior, and
                            ecological models. He is my PhD supervisor during 2015&ndash;now in University of Utah.
                            John is now dedicated to introducing plant hydraulics into gas exchange models as water
                            transport safety is a main limiting factor over stomatal behavior. Such would benefit the
                            research on gas exchange models from individual scale to land surface scale through
                            incorporating more logical and realistic water limitation to plants.

                            transport, and hydraulic methods. He enlightened many famous researchers in the field of
                            plant hydraulics including John S. Sperry, Missy Holbrook, and Herve Cochard. I was lucky
                            to visit his lab during 2013&ndash;2015 at NWAFU where he guided me into plant hydraulics.
                            After my graduating as a master, he recommended me to John S. Sperry in University of Utah
                            to continue my research career.
