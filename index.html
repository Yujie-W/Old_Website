        <h2>Who cares what?</h2>
        <p> Terrestrial plants lose water inevitably in order to photosynthesize. Plants ought to evolve
            to obtain the maximal productivity at a given environment with limited resources, such as water
            and light. There must be an optimal water use strategy to achieve the maximized fitness. What is
            the optimal strategy? Do plants archive the optimal strategy? The answers requires systematical
            understandings of plant physiology ranging from molecular biology to landscape scale ecology. One
            thing, however, is clear that optimal water use strategy is the evolutionary destination. Something
            unclear are what are the evolutionary standards, what are the driving forces, and what parameters
            are evolving.</p>
        <p> To understand these, we have to use theories and models to analyze the costs and benefits of the
            evolution as well as adaptation and acclimation. Can experimental facts help? The answer is
            positive. However, theoretical work is even more important as it may unveil the mystery of why
            and how. Simply making meta-analyses and correlations might guide people into empirical 
            conclusions, but it may not be valid. Comparatively, simply building models may result in right
            predictions, but it may not be true. Therefore, we can only believe in the results of observation
            but not the conclusion, and we can only believe the power of the theories but not the assumptions.
            Be a clever person!</p>
        <p> The Yujie's Personal Lab focuses on part of the knowledge chain that ranges from vessel scale
            to forest scale. The research are mainly on the Plant Water Relations, including experimental work
            and theories. The ultimate goals are to resolve the following aspects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How plants transport water                                     </li>
            <li>How plants use water efficiently                               </li>
            <li>How to interpret plant evolution                               </li>
            <li>How to model the plant water use                               </li>
            <li>How should we increase the plant productivity                  </li>
            <li>How to achieve the optimal equilibrium of human and environment</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Though experiments and theories are not directly coupled to Forestry and Agriculture, the power
            of theoretical tools are far more useful than empirical conclusions in the future. Yujie's Personal
            Lab would try to facilitate the applications of theories, such as instructions on conservation of
            forest and guidelines pn profit maximization of agriculture.</p>
